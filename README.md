# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

ABOUT THE TOOL
# News Annotation Tool

This is a browser-based annotation platform for labeling persuasive propaganda, inflammatory language, and misleading content in news articles. Designed for MTurk and human-subject studies.

## üöÄ Features

- Highlight text and apply structured labels
- Customizable categories and survey questions
- Supports article-by-article surveys
- JSON export or Firebase integration
- ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù screen with MTurk code

## üîß Customization via `config.js`

To adapt the tool for your own study, edit `config.js`:

- `articles`: your article text and titles
- `categoryOptions`: tags available to annotators
- `surveyQuestions`: Likert-style post-annotation questions

## üõ† Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Update `config.js`
4. Run locally: `npm start`
5. Optionally deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase

## üìÇ Example Output

At the end of the task, all annotations and survey responses are saved as structured JSON and can optionally be uploaded to Firebase.

## üß™ Designed For Research

This tool was created for a human-subject study but is reusable across research domains involving:
- Misinformation
- Bias detection
- Media literacy
